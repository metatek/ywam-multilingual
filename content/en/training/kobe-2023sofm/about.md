The main scripture is Romans 10:14-17: "How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!' But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?' So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."
The School of Frontier Missions in Kobe, Japan, is an invitation to people who sense that God has placed a calling to missions on their hearts. This school will prepare you to respond to Godâ€™s call, gain a better understanding of cross-cultural mission needs, and the Father's heart towards the nations. You will learn practical tools that prepare you for the mission.
When we prayed for the 2023 SOFM, we sensed that God would use it to help us understand and accept who we really are as God's children. Before we say, "Here I am, God, send me," we should explore ourselves and learn more about who God is. We should remember that God loves us so much and that we do missions firstly out of a response to His love for us and the love towards the people, not because of the needs in the world. In Christ, we are secure; He loves us unconditionally; He does not love us because of our response to His call. But it is because of His love that we respond to His call. We are His workmanship, and He wants to show us who He is throughout the journey we walk with Him. When we grow mature and understand His heart, then we can pray with confidence and ask God to send us to the nations (Psalm 2:8).
The harvest is ripe. Are you ready to respond to God's call?
