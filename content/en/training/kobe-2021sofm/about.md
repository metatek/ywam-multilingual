How will people hear the gospel unless someone shares it with them? The School of Frontier Missions Online equips you to serve as a frontier missionary, readying you to go to areas where Jesus is not known. That means being a cultural and language learner who shares Him in a way people can understand in their cultural context. This course will equip you no matter where you want to go as a missionary – this will get you on the field! We look at topics such as: disciple-making movements, unity and team dynamics, cultural adjustment and communication, intercession, pioneering and more.

On the frontiers, instead of being a tourist, you will be diving into the culture and language of the people God calls you to. The most effective cross-cultural missionaries are those who become "belongers," integrating themselves into the communities they are reaching. This is what Jesus modelled, making Himself one of us to show us the Father. The SOFM Online offers you tools and experience to do this effectively.

The SOFM Online provides a strong platform for serving cross-culturally, whether you know clearly you’re headed to the frontiers long-term, or you’re exploring possibilities while adding tools to your missions “toolbox.” This is a great opportunity to benefit from the years of experience represented by this course and its long track record of missionaries pioneering and serving effectively in the frontiers. Be ready to tackle the challenge of taking the gospel to the unreached!

This course includes approximately 12 to 14 hours of teaching per week, plus further time for homework, projects and small group meetings. This course earns you 12 credits with the University of the Nations.
