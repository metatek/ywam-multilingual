Most people know Hiroshima as the place where the nuclear bomb fell. Since then Hiroshima has been rebuilt and is now a thriving city with more than 1.5 million people. But even though the city has been rebuilt physically, spiritually it has been left untouched by most mission organisations. People don't know Jesus, and they are still burdened with pain from the past.

We go in the opposite spirit and bring life where there was death. We believe Hiroshima is a key city to seeing healing within Japan and reconciliation between nations. It is time for this "City of Peace", as it is often called, to know peace not of this world, but true peace that comes from Jesus.
