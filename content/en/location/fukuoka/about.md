YWAM Fukuoka started in January 2023. Fukuoka Prefecture is the most populous prefecture in the Kyushu region, Fukuoka City is the most populous city in the Kyushu region, and is the second most populous city in Western Japan after Osaka City. The reclamation has just started and we will establish ourselves with worship and prayer first.

"Raise your heads, ye gates. Go up, O gates of eternity. The King of Glory is coming in.
Who is the King of Glory? strong and mighty lord. A mighty lord in battle.
Gates, raise your heads. Eternal door, go up! The King of Glory will come in.
King of Glory Who is it? Lord of hosts, this is the king of glory. Sera"

Psalm 24:7-10
