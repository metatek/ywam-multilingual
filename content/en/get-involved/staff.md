Whatever way you want to serve God, you can most likely do it in YWAM! Being on staff with YWAM is an adventure in faith. Join staff for a couple of years, or stay for life.

In many of our locations, one of the joys of joining staff is to serve side by side with people from a variety of nations. Our staff come from numerous different Christian denominations and nearly half of our staff come from Non-Western countries, such as Brazil, South Korea, Indonesia, India and Nepal.

Here are a few of the many staff openings in YWAM:

* Accountants
* Graphic Designers
* Evangelists
* Receptionists
* Administrators
* Church Planters
* Teachers
* Physicians/Nurses
* Cooks
* Carpenters
* Journalists/Editors

## Salary and Benefits

YWAM does not pay its staff. Most of our staff meet their financial needs by partnering with friends and churches who support their ministry. In some areas, our staff work in other businesses for financial, practical or ministry reasons.

## How to Apply

To join YWAM staff you first need to complete a Discipleship Training School (DTS). DTS is the prerequisite to all our other training and opportunities and is offered at over 600 locations around the world.
