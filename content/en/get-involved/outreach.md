Spend some time designing a website, working with local churches, maintaining an old building, ministering to the homeless, proclaiming the gospel, playing sports with locals, or doing one of hundreds of other jobs alongside YWAM’s full-time staff.

For individuals, YWAM’s [Mission Builders](https://www.missionbuilders.org/) ministry specializes in helping people volunteer with YWAM. Alternatively, you can contact a location directly to find how you can serve.

For groups, you can come as a family with children, as a church group, youth group, or outreach as part of a YWAM school based in a different country. Please contact specific locations in Japan about possibilities.
