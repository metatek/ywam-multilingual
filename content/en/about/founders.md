> "Loren and Darlene, through their obedience to the Lord, have transformed the global mission movement. Their actions directly affected countless lives from every nation!" - Rev. Leonard Ravenhill

YWAM was founded by Loren Cunningham in 1960 after God gave him a vision of waves of young people crashing onto the shores of all nations of the world with the Gospel. Loren also co-founded the University of the Nations in 1978 in order to better train and equip people for missions. As YWAM is a decentralised mission with no global headquarters, Loren and his wife Darlene make up part of YWAM's Founders' Circle overseeing the mission and pointing YWAMers across the world back to Jesus.
