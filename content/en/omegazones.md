# Reaching ALL of Japan: 4k Mapping

YWAM has developed a mapping initiative called "4K" which aims to help Christian workers all over the world better understand where the spiritual and physical needs are.

The world has been divided up into around 4,200 **Omega Zones**. These are determined by population, geopolitical divisions, availability of the Gospel, spiritual needs, and basic life needs.

A vision of YWAM is to establish ministries and disciple-making movements (church planting) in all of these 4,200 Omega Zones.

# Omega Zones in Japan

Japan has a total of 53 Omega Zones. Currently 42 Omega Zones have no YWAM ministries.
