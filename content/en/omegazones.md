# Reaching ALL of Japan

YWAM has developed a mapping initiative called "4K" which aims to help Christian workers all over the world better understand where the spiritual and physical needs are.

The world has been divided up into around 4,200 **Omega Zones**. These are determined by population, geopolitical divisions, availability of the Gospel, spiritual needs, and basic life needs.

A vision of YWAM is to establish ministries and disciple-making movements (church planting) in all of these 4,200 Omega Zones.

# Omega Zones in Japan

Japan has a total of 53 Omega Zones. Currently 41 Omega Zones have no YWAM ministries.

Here you can find a table detailing all of the Omega Zones in Japan, separated by region. The Major Metropolitan Areas (MMAs) have also been highlighted as these are key areas to focus on.
