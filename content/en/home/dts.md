Start with the [Discipleship Training School (DTS)]({{< ref "/dts/index.md" >}}). Spend six months centring your life in God. Seek personal breakthroughs. Stretch yourself by serving God in a cross-cultural setting. For a shorter opportunity, you can also start by volunteering or by joining a mission trip.
